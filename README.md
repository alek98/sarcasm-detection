The goal of a project is to detect sarcasm in news headlines using neural networks. A text headline is fed into neural network and output is `sarcastic` or `not sarcastic`. 
You can find dataset [here](https://github.com/rishabhmisra/News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection).

**94% accuracy** achived on test set using roBERTa model.
